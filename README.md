					                                 PROBLEMS
With such a large population in India, it is very difficult for an equitable and fair distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. According to a report in the Times of India, it could take up to 2 yrs. to provide the vaccine to approx. 60% of the population. With the wide dissimilarity in the population demographics and inequitable distribution of resources among the population, it is important that scientific and organized systems are used. Thus, it is essential to have an ordered fast-paced system for providing the vaccine efficiently and without any prejudice. Nivaran targets this urgent issue and aims to provide a practical and implementable solution. 
			
			                                          
								         SOLUTION 
We are proposing a radically new solution to overcome this problem of distribution of the vaccine that is the need of the hour:
1) “Vaccination centers” will have to be created similar to the voting centers to vaccinate people in a particular area.
2) Each person living in the area will have to register themselves on the proposed Nivaran app by entering various details like name, age, Aadhar card, age, comorbidity, location as well as income level.
3) The app will then verify the credentials and will send an OTP based on the phone number linked with the Aadhar card.
4)After this, the people will be sorted based on their age, comorbidity, location as well as income level to select the people who need to be vaccinated on priority. This priority will be based on the algorithm made.
5) Based on this each person will be sent a QR code along with the date, time, and nearest center. The person will have to get his QR code scanned at the center to avail of vaccination. 
6) After vaccination, the person will receive a code which when entered in the app will generate a certificate that can be used for easy inter territory travel.
 
 
 
					                                  KEY FEATURES 
Nivaran has the potential to be practically implemented and be scaled up to meet the requirement of the entire nation thus efficiently be used for ultimate “nivarana” from the pandemic. It has the following key features:
1)	User-friendly app in multiple regional languages.
2)	An organized platform for authorities to implement the process of vaccination against COVID-19.
3)	The efficient and equitable distribution process of the COVID-19 vaccine.
4)	Provides a holistic algorithm that adheres to the criteria of vaccine distribution as suggested by the government. 
5)	Flexible and adaptable to change in the future if required as per government guidelines.


                                                                 
								              IMPACT 
Our Idea is a revolutionary idea unlike any other that already exists. It is the need of the hour as such a system needs to be in place as soon as the vaccine comes out in the market so as avoid a chaotic situation and felicitate a quick distribution of the much-needed COVID-19 vaccine. The consequences would be severe if such an organized system is not in place in conjunction with the release of the COVID-19 vaccine and could result in an increased number of COVID-19 cases, malpractices, etc.
It is a very urgent issue to be addressed as soon as the vaccines will be available in the market. Thorough planning aided by our application and algorithm will help in an efficient roll-out of the vaccination program.
